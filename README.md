# Synthetic News Generation

## Overview

This project generates a synthetic dataset of fictitious news articles using a language model, then processes the data to create a structured CSV file. The goal is to generate unique and diverse news articles on various topics and structure them for use in subsequent tasks like retrieval or further analysis.

### Project Components:
1. **News Generation Script**: Generates synthetic news articles using a language model (e.g., LLaMA).
2. **CSV Conversion Script**: Processes the generated news articles and converts them into a CSV file with structured data (title, author, date, and content).

## Project Structure

```bash
.
├── generate_news.py                   # Script to generate synthetic news articles
├── convert_to_csv_dataset.py          # Script to convert generated articles to CSV format
├── synthetic_dataset_generation/      # Folder for generated articles and datasets
│   ├── synthetic_news.txt             # Text file containing generated news articles
│   └── synthetic_news.csv             # CSV file with parsed news articles
└── README.md                          # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.8+
- The following Python packages:
  - `langchain-core`
  - `langchain-groq`
  - `dotenv`
  - `random`
  - `csv`
  - `re`

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Scripts

### 1. `generate_news.py`

This script generates synthetic news articles across a variety of topics (e.g., Politics, Economy, Sports, Science). The articles are saved in a text file with each article separated by a line of dashes.

#### Usage:

```bash
python generate_news.py
```

#### Key Features:

- Generates between 500-1000 words per article.
- Diverse topics: politics, economy, sports, science, culture, technology, etc.
- Each article contains a **title**, **author**, **date**, and **content**.
- Saves articles to `synthetic_dataset_generation/synthetic_news.txt`.

#### Example Output (in text file):

```
**Title:** Breakthrough in Quantum Computing: Tech Giant NovaSphere Unveils Revolutionary New Processor
**Author:** Alex Chen
**Date:** March 20, 2027

In a major breakthrough in the field of quantum computing...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Title:** Revolutionary AI-Powered Quantum Computer Unveiled by Tech Giant, NovaTech
**Author:** Emily Chen
**Date:** March 25, 2027

In a breakthrough announcement that is set to send shockwaves throughout the tech industry...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### 2. `convert_to_csv_dataset.py`

This script reads the generated news articles from the text file and parses them into a structured format. It extracts fields such as **title**, **author**, **date**, and **content** and stores them in a CSV file.

#### Usage:

```bash
python convert_to_csv_dataset.py
```

#### Key Features:

- Reads from the `synthetic_news.txt` file.
- Extracts structured data: title, author, date, and content.
- Saves the parsed data in `synthetic_news.csv`.

#### Example CSV Output:

| idx | title                                                                                 | author     | date         | content                                                                                                    |

## How to Run

### Step 1: Generate Synthetic News Articles

Run the `generate_news.py` script to generate news articles:

```bash
python generate_news.py
```

This will output a text file with the generated articles in `synthetic_dataset_generation/synthetic_news.txt`.

### Step 2: Convert Generated News to CSV

Once you have generated the news articles, you can convert them into a CSV file for further use by running:

```bash
python convert_to_csv_dataset.py
```

The output will be saved in `synthetic_dataset_generation/synthetic_news.csv`.

## Customization

- **Number of Articles**: You can change the number of news articles generated by modifying the `num_news` variable in `generate_news.py`.
- **Topics**: You can customize the list of topics in the `generate_new` method of `generate_news.py`.
- **CSV Output**: If you need additional fields or different formatting, modify the `convert_to_csv_dataset.py` script.

## Future Enhancements

- **Embedding and Retrieval**: Integrate FAISS or another retrieval system to create embeddings from the generated news articles for retrieval tasks.
- **Additional Formats**: Support output in formats such as JSON, XML, etc.
